# Description
The following project creates a typical e-commerce backend with a MySql database and column definitions that may be typical among an online store.

Using an express server, API endpoints are exposed that would allow a user to create, read, update and delete objects from the database as well
as organize items into categories



# Installation
After cloning repo, navigate to the 'db' directory where a schema.sql file exits. Open SQL Shell and run:  
```source schema.sql```  

This will create the database needed but not the tables  

Run  
```npm i```  
to install dependencies  

If you'd like to use seed data run  
```npm run seed```

With the database now situated, run  
```npm run start```


# Usage
This project is meant to be used purely on the backend, exposing common CRUD API endpoints for a
typical e-commerce store and querying a database accordingly. The seed data can be ignored and tables
used differently as per the needs of a project
